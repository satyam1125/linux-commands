# Linux Basics and Ethical Hacking Commands  

Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Satyam. 
This repo is just a place where Iâ€™m keeping track of all the Linux commands Iâ€™m learning while working on **Kali Linux**.  

Iâ€™ve started with the basics (navigation, files, users, permissions) and Iâ€™m slowly moving towards commands that are useful in **ethical hacking** (like networking, scanning, and system monitoring).  

---

## What youâ€™ll find here
- Basic Linux commands everyone should know 
- Commands related to files, directories, and permissions 
- Networking commands that are important for pentesting 
- Monitoring and system commands I use often 
- A growing list of ethical hacking tools 

Iâ€™m writing everything down in [`commands.md`](./commands.md) so that I can refer back later.

## Why Iâ€™m doing this
Iâ€™m learning Linux from scratch and wanted a simple repo where I can:  
- Practice git and GitHub 
- Keep my notes in one place 
- Show my progress to others (and maybe help beginners too) 

---

## Example Commands
```bash
pwd                 # check where I am
ls -la              # list all files with details
nmap -sV 127.0.0.1  # scan my own system

Thatâ€™s all for now. Iâ€™ll keep updating this as I learn more.
